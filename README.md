# MongoDB $inc operator with string value
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB, where a string value is provided instead of a number.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  Attempting to use it with a string will result in an error or unexpected behavior.

The solution shows the correct usage of `$inc` with a numeric value.
